    "# Run expectancy, win expectancy, and the exceptions that make baseball interesting #\n",
    "## Baseball as state machine ##\n",
    "### Base-out states ###\n",
    "In any baseball time, at any time in the game, the game is always in one of 24 possible base-out states. The base-out states describe the number of outs and positions of the runners on the bases. For example, there can be no outs and bases empty, two outs and bases loaded, one out and a runner on second, and so on. Events in the inning cause a change in the base-out state. Individual pitches don't necessarily cause a change, there has to be an event associated with the pitch, such as a walk, hit, stolen base, ground ball to second, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an inning, there are 0, 1, or 2 outs. For each of the outs, there are 8 configurations for runners on base, for a total of 24 states. The 25th state is when there are 3 outs in the inning. At that point, it's irrelevant how many runners are on the bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run Expectancy ##\n",
    "Run Expectancy (RE) is the expected number of runs that will score from the current base-out state to the end of the inning. We can calculate the RE for each of the 24 base-out states by looking at total runs scored from that state to the end of an inning.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RE_s=\\frac{Runs}{n_s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples ###\n",
    "#### Start of an inning ####\n",
    "* Every inning starts in the same base-out state: no outs and bases empty. \n",
    "* From 2010-2015, the average runs per game was 4.15, which results in average runs per inning of 0.461. \n",
    "* The 0.461 is the expected number of runs that an average team will score in an inning at the beginning of an inning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RE for all base-out states 2010-2015 ###\n",
    "The RE for all base-out states for any year, or any sequence of years, can be calculated from the data we have available to us. Or, we can look at values that someone else has already calculated. They don't change that much year to year. \n",
    "\n",
    "These numbers are based on the league average for each state. They tell us how many runs an average team in average conditions will score from that state until the end of the inning.\n",

    "#### Leadoff batter gets on base ####\n",
    "* If the leadoff batter gets on first, the RE for the inning increases to 0.859.\n",
    "* If he gets a triple, the RE for the inning increases to 1.350.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run values of events ##\n",
    "* In the RE table, we see that a single with bases empty and no outs increases the RE from 0.461 to 0.859. This means that a single in that situation is worth 0.398 runs. The single is the event that caused the increase in RE.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A triple in this situation is worth 1.350-0.461 = 0.889. \n",
    "\n",
    "* We can assign run values to events, such as singles, doubles, walks, hbp, etc by examining how many runs score just before the event to the end of the inning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run values give us player contributions to scoring ###\n",
    "* In any season, we know how many plate appearances a batter had and the outcome of those plate appearances. We count them. \n",
    "* We can calculate a player's run value if we know the average number of runs that each outcome produces. \n",
    "* For example, if we know the run value of a single and how many singles a player gets in a season, we know how many runs a player contributed in a season through their singles.\n",
    "* We want to know a player's run value above the run value of an average player.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating run values of events ###\n",
    "* Events happen in base-out states, which all have an RE value. \n",
    "* After the event, there is a new base-out state with a (potentially) different RE value.\n",
    "* The run value of an event in a base-out state is $End_s + runs - Start_s$, which is RE for ending base-out state + runs scored on the play - the RE for the starting base-out state.\n",
    "* The run value of an event is the weighted value of the event in all base out states. We weight the value of the event by how many times it happens, historically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples ####\n",
    "1. With bases empty and no outs, a batter hits a homerun. The starting RE was 0.461, one run scored, and the ending RE was 0.461. A homerun in this situation has a value of 1.\n",
    "2. With bases loaded and two outs, a batter hits a homerun. The starting RE was 0.752. The ending base-out state was bases empty and two outs, which has an RE 0.098. The run value of that homerun was $0.098+4-0.752=3.346$.\n",
    "3. With runners on first and second and one out, the batter flies out to the second baseman and runners don't advance. The starting RE was 0.884. The ending base-out state is runners on first and second with two outs, which has an RE of 0.429. The run value of that out was $0.429+0-0.884=-0.455$. Outs typically have negative run value. \n",
    "4. Why is a grand slam with two outs not worth 4 runs? Because, with bases loaded and 2 outs, we expect the average batter to produce 0.752 runs. We want to capture the value of the grand slam above what an average batter would do in that situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run value of a HR ###\n",
    "Using data from 1999-2002, copyright Tom Tango, we can calculate the run value of a HR. Note: these are different RE values than shown previously because it's a different time period. I'm also not showing the entire matrix, just select rows.\n",

    "In the 2004 ALCS, the Boston Red Sox were trailing the New York Yankees 3 games to 1 in the best of 7 series. NY only needed to win one more game to advance to the World Series. In the bottom of the ninth inning, the Red Sox were losing 3-4 and Mariano Rivera, the NY closer was pitching. Rivera had been perfect in previous games. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Red Sox are another team that hadn't won the World Series in many years, since 1918 to be exact.\n",

    "Watch what happened next: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYBZeU46LL4\">Dave Roberts stolen base</a>\n",
    "As a player, Roberts who had an average playing career. He spent several years in the minor leagues and was a regular player in the majors for only a few seasons. \n",

    "# Questions #\n",
    "1. Why does RE consider runs scored until end of the inning and not just on that play?\n",
    "2. Would the team at bat prefer to have a man on first and no outs or a man on third and two outs? \n",
    "3. What data would you need to calculate RE values at different ballparks?\n",
    "4. Why do we include both the start and the end RE in our calculation of run value for an event?"
