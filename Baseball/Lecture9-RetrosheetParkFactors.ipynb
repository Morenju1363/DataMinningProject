The MVP typically goes to players who help their team offensively. They also need to be solid defensively, but without gaudy offensive numbers, a player doesn't win the MVP. Walker played half of his games at Coors Field, which we already know is a hitter's paradise, and Piazza played half of his games at Dodgers Stadium, which is a more neutral park.
