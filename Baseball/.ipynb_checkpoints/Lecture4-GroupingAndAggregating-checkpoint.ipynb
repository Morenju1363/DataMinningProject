    "# Grouping and aggregating data #\n",
    "This guy has a great tutorial on <a href=\"https://www.shanelynn.ie/summarising-aggregation-and-grouping-data-in-python-pandas/\" target=\"_blank\">Summarising, Aggregating, and Grouping data in Pandas.</a>\n",
    "### Motivating questions ###\n",
    "We need to group data and calculate aggregate values to answer questions such as:\n",
    "1. How do teams compare to each other? - Group rows of data by team.\n",
    "2. Can we compare a player's strikeouts from one year to the next? - Group rows of data by year.\n",
    "3. Can we compare a team's home and road performance, or performance at different parks? - Group rows of data by game location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL vs. Pandas ###\n",
    "If you're familiar with SQL, you might find it helpful to see how the SQL commands compare to the equivalent Pandas commands.\n",
    "<a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/comparison/comparison_with_sql.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pandas and SQL</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas groupby###\n",
    "There are times when you want to group the individual rows in a dataframe by some parameter, perform a calculation on the group, and then recombine the results. Use GROUP BY to split the data into groups, then aggregate the data in each group, then display the aggregate calculations as one or more columns in a dataframe or series.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "How many pitchers did each MLB team use in 2015?\n",
    "1. Read the pitching tables, which contains each individual pitcher that appeared in 2015."
