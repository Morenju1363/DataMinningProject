    "# Assigning value to players in terms of wins #\n",
    "Imagine you're the General Manager for an MLB team and the owner tells you that you have an additional $30M$ to spend on players for the upcoming season. But, he wants results. If your team doesn't win more games next year than it did this year, you're fired. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Goal: Find players who will maximize your team's win total within the fixed constraint of your budget.__\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world, you'll find players who are \"undervalued\", their contribution to win production is greater than you would expect for the salary they're paid. The original \"undervalued\" criteria was On-Base-Percentage (OBP). Branch Rickey with the Brooklyn Dodgers and then later Billy Beane with the Oakland A's, realized that high OBP players contributed to wins and since OBP wasn't valued as a stat, these players were relatively cheap. Today, everyone knows about OBP, so high OBP players are paid what they're worth.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wins Above Replacement (WAR)#\n",
    "Evaluating players based on their WAR is the latest thing, and it will be with us for awhile. WAR is not an individual stat, but rather a framework that pulls together lots of individual stats to evaluate the value of a player in terms of how many wins the player contributes to the team in given season. There are different ways of calculating WAR and probably endless debates possible about which one is the best. There are also proprietary formulas that individual MLB teams use, and don't share with the rest of the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the specific WAR formula, the basic idea is the same: \n",
    "\n",
    "__WAR is the number of wins a player contributes over a replacement-level player.__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Replacement-level player ###\n",
    "A replacement-level player is a player brought up from the Minors making the league-minimum salary. It's not the average MLB player. The average MLB player is still pretty good and collects a serious salary. The Minor League players are effectively \"free\", they work for minimum wage. So, WAR evaluates what a player brings to the team over what the team could get for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assigning value to players ##\n",
    "Consider everything the player does and how well he does each thing and add those things together to get his value on the field. There are also off-the-field things to consider, such as having a star player might increase ticket sales, but that's another conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Position specific - Consider his abilities relative to other players at his position.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Catchers can steal strikes through pitch framing, or lose strikes by receiving poorly, and contribute to the game through how he calls the game.\n",

A starting pitcher who sticks around for a full season with league average stats is worth a lot of money.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Example: If you could have league average starting pitcher for 200 innings or slightly better than average reliever for 66 innings, which do you pick? The starter.

    "You can think of Marginal Payroll/Marginal Wins (MP/MW) as how well does your team do compared to how well they would do if you spent minimum wage to put a team on the field. Spending the minimum is baseline performance for how well you spend money and recruit players. MP/MW evaluates how efficiently a front office spends money to acquire talented players for the team.
